# BASIC COMMANDS 

# alias 
# usualy a shortened form of a command
# see ll example in ~/.bashrc

# see if command is alias, internal or external
type pwd
type man
type ll

# internal command is part of the shell
# external command is found on disk through the PATH variable

# environment variables
# find out what shell you're using
echo $SHELL
# check the PATH variable
echo $PATH
# $PATH variable can be set for specific users

# shows path to bin if the path is already present in $PATH
which man

# ls : Display the contents of the directory. 
# If you call the command without parameters, it shows you
# the contents of the current directory.
ls 

# pwd : Display the path to the current directory.
# When you add the -W parameter, the command displays the
# path in the Windows directory structure.
pwd

# cd : Go to the directory at the specified 
# relative or absolute path. 
cd /tmp
cd .. 
cd ~

# exercises
# 1. Type time ls. This executes the ls command where the Bash internal time
# shows information about the time it took to complete this command.
# 2. Type which time. This shows the filename /usr/bin/time that was found in the
# $PATH variable.
# 3. Type time, which shows that time is a shell keyword.
# 4. Type echo $PATH to show the contents of the $PATH variable. You can
# see that /usr/bin is included in the list, but because there also is an internal
# command time, the time command from the path will not be executed unless
# you tell the shell specifically to do so—the command in step 2 has executed the
# internal command for you because of command precedence.
# 5. Type /usr/bin/time ls to run the /usr/bin/time command when executing
# ls. You’ll notice that the output differs completely. Ignore the meaning of the
# output; we get back to that later. What matters for now is that you realize that
# these are really two different commands.

Standard Input, Output, and Error 
Name    File Descriptor Number
STDIN   0
STDOUT  1
STDERR  2

Common Bash Redirectors
Redirector        Explanation
> (same as 1>)    Redirects STDOUT. If redirection is to a file, the current contents of that file are overwritten.
>> (same as 1>>)  Redirects STDOUT in append mode. If output is written to a file, the output is appended to that file.
2>                Redirects STDERR.
2>&1              Redirects STDERR to the same destination as STDOUT. Notice that this has to be used in combination with normal output redirection,as in ls whuhiu > errout 2>&1.
< (same as 0<)    Redirects STDIN.

# pipe : send the output of one command to another
history | grep ls

# exercises
# 1. Type ls. You’ll see the ls command output onscreen.
# 2. Type ls > /dev/null. This redirects STDOUT to the null device, with the result
# that you will not see it.
# 3. Type ls ilwehgi > /dev/null. This command shows a “no such file or directory”
# message onscreen. You see the message because it is not STDOUT, but rather an
# error message that is written to STDERR.
# 4. Type ls ilwehgi 2> /dev/null. Now you will no longer see the error message.
# 5. Type ls ilwehgi /etc 2> /dev/null. This shows the contents of the /etc folder
# while hiding the error message.
# 6. Type ls ilwehgi /etc 2> /dev/null > output. In this command, you still write
# the error message to /dev/null while sending STDOUT to a file with the name
# output that will be created in your home directory.
# 7. Type cat output to show the contents of this file.
# 8. Type echo hello > output. This overwrites the contents of the output file. Verify
# this by using cat output again.
# 9. Type ls >> output. This appends the result of the ls command to the output file.
# Type cat output to verify.
# 10. Type ls -R /. This shows a long list of files and folders scrolling over your
# computer monitor. (You might want to press Ctrl-C to stop [or wait some time]).
# 11. Type ls -R /. | less. This shows the same result, but in the less pager, where you
# can scroll up and down using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
# 12. Type q to close less. This will also end the ls program.
# 13. Type ls > /dev/tty1. This gives an error message because you are executing the
# command as an ordinary user, and ordinary users cannot address device files
# directly (unless you were logged in to tty1). Only the user root has permission to
# write to device files directly.

# view history of commands run so far
history
# Type !number to execute a command with a specific number from history.
# Type !sometext to execute the last command that starts with sometext. 
# Use history -d number to delete a specific command from history. 
# type history -c to clear the current history.
# if you want to remove both the current history and the contents of the .bash_history file,
# then type history -w immediately after running the history -c command.

# exercises
# 1. Type history to get an overview of commands that you have previously used.
# 2. Type some commands, such as the following:
# ls
# pwd
# cat /etc/hosts
# ls –l
# The goal is to fill the history a bit.
# 3. Open a second terminal on your server. To do so, click Activities in the upper-
# left corner, and in the Search bar, type term. Next, click the terminal window to
# start it.
# 4. Type history from this second terminal window. Notice that you do not see
# the commands that you just typed in the other terminal. The reason is that the
# history file has not been updated yet.
# 5. From the first terminal session, press Ctrl-r. From the prompt that opens now,
# type ls. You’ll see the last ls command you used. Press Ctrl-r again. You’ll now see
# that you are looking backward and that the previous ls command is highlighted.
# Press Enter to execute it.
# 6. Type history | grep cat. The grep command searches the history output for any
# commands that contain the text cat. Note the command number of one of the cat
# commands you have previously used.
# 7. Type !nn, where nn is replaced by the number you noted in step 7. You’ll see that
# the last cat command is repeated.
# 8. Close this terminal by typing exit.
# 9. From the remaining terminal window, type history -c. This wipes all history that
# is currently in memory. Close this terminal session as well.
# 10. Open a new terminal session and type history. The result may be a bit unex-
# pected, but you’ll see a list of commands anyway. The reason is that history -c
# clears the in-memory history, but it does not remove the .bash_history file in
# your home directory.

# using autocompletion with tab
# 1. Still from a user shell, type gd and press Tab. You’ll see that nothing happens.
# 2. Press Tab again. Bash now shows a short list of all commands that start with the
# letters gd.
# 3. To make it clear to Bash what you want, type i (so that your prompt at this point
# shows the command gdi). Press Tab again. Bash now completes the command to
# gdisk. Press Enter to launch it, and press Enter again to close it.
# 4. Use cd /etc to go to the /etc directory.
# 5. Type cat ps and press Tab. Because there is one file only that starts with pas, Bash
# knows what to do and automatically completes the filename to passwd. Press
# Enter to execute the command.
# using tab is important for speed but also correctness for example when tabing in a long path

# vim cheat sheet
# Command        Explanation
# Esc            Switches from input mode to command mode. Press this key before typing any command.
# i, a           Switches from command mode to input mode at (i) or after (a) the current cursor position.
# o              Opens a new line below the current cursor position and goes to input mode.
# :wq            Writes the current file and quits.
# :q!            Quits the file without applying any changes. The ! forces the command to do its work. Add the ! only if you really know what you are doing.
# :w             filename Writes the current file with a new filename.
# dd             Deletes the current line and places the contents of the deleted line into memory.
# yy             Copies the current line.
# p              Pastes the contents that have been cut or copied into memory.
# v              Enters visual mode, which allows you to select a block of text using the arrow keys. Use d to cut the selection or y to copy it.
# u              Undoes the last command. Repeat as often as necessary.
# Ctrl-r         Redoes the last undo. (Cannot be repeated more than once.)
# gg             Goes to the first line in the document.
# G              Goes to the last line in the document.
# /text          Searches for text from the current cursor position forward.
# ?text          Searches for text from the current cursor position backward.
# ^              Goes to the first position in the current line.
# $              Goes to the last position in the current line.
# !ls            Adds the output of ls (or any other command) in the current file.
# :%s/old/new/g  Replaces all occurrences of old with new.

# exercises
# 1. Type vim ~/testfile. This starts vim and opens a file with the name testfile in ~,
# which represents your current home directory.
# 2. Type i to enter input mode and then type the following text:
# cow
# sheep
# ox
# chicken
# snake
# fish
# oxygen
# 3. Press Esc to get back to command mode and type :w to write the file using the
# same filename.
# 4. Type :3 to go to line number 3.
# 5. Type dd to delete this line.
# 6. Type dd again to delete another line.
# 7. Type u to undo the last deletion.
# 8. Type o to open a new line.
# 9. Enter some more text at the current cursor position:
# tree
# farm
# 10. Press Esc to get back into command mode.
# 11. Type :%s/ox/OX/g and note the changes to the line that contained ox.
# 12. Type :wq to write the file and quit. If for some reason that does not work,
# use :wq!

# see all environment variables
env

# env file locations
# /etc/profile: This is the generic file that is processed by all users upon login.
# /etc/bashrc: This file is processed when subshells are started.
# ~/.bash_profile: In this file, user-specific login shell variables can be defined.
# ~/.bashrc: In this user-specific file, subshell variables can be defined.

# banners
# To display messages during the login process, Bash uses the /etc/motd and the /etc/ issue files.

# exercises
# 1. Type echo $LANG to show the contents of the variable that sets your system
# keyboard and language settings.
# 2. Type ls --help. You’ll see that help about the ls command is displayed in the
# current language settings of your computer.
# 3. Type LANG=es_ES.UTF-8. This temporarily sets the language variable to
# Spanish. Type ls --help again to verify.
# 4. Type exit to close your terminal window. Because you have not changed the
# contents of any of the previously mentioned files, when you open a new shell, the
# original value of the LANG variable will be used.
# 5. Open a shell as user again.
# 6. Verify the current value of the LANG variable by typing echo $LANG.
# 7. Type vim .bashrc to open the .bashrc configuration file.
# 8. In this file, add the line COLOR=red to set a variable with the name COLOR
# and assign it the value red. Notice that this variable doesn’t really change
# anything on your system; it just sets a variable.
# 9. Close the user shell and open a new user shell.
# 10. Verify that the variable COLOR has been set, by using echo $COLOR.
# Because the .bashrc file is included in the login procedure, the variable is set after
# logging in.

# --help
# Nearly all commands provide a short overview of help when the option --help
# is used. Some commands do not honor that option and consider it erroneous.
# Fortunately, these commands will be so friendly as to show an error message,
# displaying valid options with the command, which effectively means that you’ll get
# what you needed anyway.

# accessing documentation
man ls
# To get to the bottom of the man page as fast as possible, use the G command. 
# You can also type /example to search the man page for any examples.
# You can search the mandb database by using apropos or man -k

# update documentation database
mandb

# exercises
# 1. Because man -k does not give the expected result, it makes sense to look in the
# man page for the man command for additional information about man -k. Type
# man man to open the man page of man. Once in the man page, type /-k to look
# for a description of the -k option. Type n a few times until you get to the line that
# describes the option. You’ll see that man -k is equivalent to apropos and that
# you can read the man page of apropos for more details. So type q to exit this man
# page.
# 2. Type man apropos and read the first paragraphs of the description. You’ll see
# that the database searched by apropos is updated by the mandb program.
# 3. Type man mandb. This man page explains how to run mandb to update the
# mandb database. As you’ll read, all you need to do is type mandb, which does the
# work for you.
# 4. Type sudo mandb to update the mandb database. Notice that you won’t see
# many man pages being added if the mandb database was already up to date.

# Using info
# exercises 
# 1. Type man ls. Type G to go to the end of the man page and look at the “See
# Also” section. It tells you that the full documentation for ls is maintained as a
# Texinfo manual that can be shown with the info command. Quit the man page by
# pressing q.
# 2. Type pinfo ‘(coreutils) ls invocation’. This shows the information about ls
# usage in the pinfo page. Read through it and press q when done. Alternatively,
# you can use the info command, but pinfo shows nicer formatting.

# /usr/share/doc
# Find info about rsyslog, bind, Kerberos, OpenSSL, and others. 
# For some services, even sample files are included.

# sample review questions for spaced repetition
# 1. What is a variable?
# 2. Which command enables you to find the correct man page based on keyword usage?
# 3. Which file do you need to change if you want a variable to be set for user bob when this user logs in?
# 4. When analyzing how to use a command, you read that the documentation is maintained with the Techinfo system. How can you read the information?
# 5. What is the name of the file where Bash stores its history?
# 6. Which command enables you to update the database that contains man keywords?
# 7. How can you undo the last modification you have applied in vim?
# 8. What can you add to a command to make sure that it does not show an error message, assuming that you do not care about the information that is in the error messages either?
# 9. How do you read the current contents of the $PATH variable?
# 10. How do you repeat the last command you used that contains the string dog somewhere in the command?

# lab 1
# 1. Modify your shell environment so that on every subshell that is started, a variable is set. The name of the variable should be COLOR, and the value should be set to red. 
# Verify that it is working.
# 2. Use the appropriate tools to find the command that you can use to change a user password. 
# Do you need root permissions to use this command?
# 3. From your home directory, type the command ls -al wergihl * and ensure that errors as well as regular output are redirected to a file with the name /tmp/ lsoutput.


# file system
# Directory       Use
# /               Specifies the root directory. This is where the file system tree starts.
# /boot           Contains all files and directories that are needed to boot the Linux kernel.
# /dev            Contains device files that are used for accessing physical devices. This directory is essential during boot.
# /etc            Contains configuration files that are used by programs and services on your server. This directory is essential during boot.
# /home           Used for local user home directories.
# /media, /mnt    Contain directories that are used for mounting devices in the file system tree.
# /opt            Used for optional packages that may be installed on your server.
# /proc           Used by the proc file system. This is a file system structure that gives access to kernel information.
# /root           Specifies the home directory of the root user.
# /run            Contains process and user-specific information that has been created since the last boot.
# /srv            May be used for data by services like NFS, FTP, and HTTP.
# /sys            Used as an interface to different hardware devices that are managed by the Linux kernel and associated processes.
# /tmp            Contains temporary files that may be deleted without any warning during boot.
# /usr            Contains subdirectories with program files, libraries for these program files, and documentation about them.
# /var            Contains files that may change in size dynamically, such as log files, mail boxes, and spool files.

# mount concept 
# A mount is a connection between a device and a directory. 
# A Linux file system is presented as one hierarchy, with the root directory (/) as its starting point. 
# This hierarchy may be distributed over different devices and even computer systems that are mounted into the root directory.
# In the process of mounting, a device is connected to a specific directory, such that after a successful mount this directory gives access to the device contents.
# It's similar to adding another hard disk to a windows device

# mount command
mount
# The mount command gives an overview of all mounted devices.

# findmnt
findmnt
# The findmnt command shows mounts and the relationship that exists between the different mounts. 

# df 
df - Th
# The df -Th command was designed to show available disk space on mounted devices; it includes most of the system mounts. 
# The -h option summarizes the output of the command in a human-readable way, and the -T option shows which file system type is used on the different mounts.
# Let's take a look at the output and try to understand it

# Wildcard  Use
# *         Refers to an unlimited number of any characters. ls *, for instance, shows all files in the current directory (except those that have a name starting with a dot).
# ?         Used to refer to one specific character that can be any character. ls c?t would match cat as well as cut.
# [auo]     Refers to one character that may be selected from the range that is specified between square brackets. ls c[auo]t would match cat, cut, and cot.

# exercises folders
# 1. Open a shell. Type cd. Next, type pwd, which stands for print working directory. 
# You’ll see that you are currently in your home directory; that is, name /home/<username>.
# 2. Type touch file1. This command creates an empty file with the name file1 on your server. 
# Because you currently are in your home directory, you can create any file you want to.
# 3. Type cd /. This changes the current directory to the root (/) directory. 
# Type touch file2. You’ll see a “permission denied” message. 
# Ordinary users can create files only in directories where they have the permissions needed for this.
# 4. Type cd /tmp. This brings you to the /tmp directory, where all users have write permissions. 
# Again, type touch file2. 
# You’ll see that you can create items in the /tmp directory (unless there is already a file2 that is owned by somebody else).
# 5. Type cd without any arguments. This command brings you back to your home directory.
# 6. Type mkdir files. This creates a directory with the name files in the current directory. 
# The mkdir command uses the name of the directory that needs to be created as a relative pathname; it is relative to the position you are currently in.
# 7. Type mkdir /home/$USER/files. In this command, you are using the variable $USER, which is substituted with your current username. 
# The complete argument of mkdir is an absolute filename to the files directory that you are trying to create. 
# Because this directory already exists, you’ll get a “file exists” error message.
# 8. Type rmdir files to remove the files directory that you have just created. 
# The rmdir command enables you to remove directories, but it works only if the directory is empty and does not contain any files.

# absolute paths
# An absolute filename, or absolute pathname, is a complete path reference to the file or directory you want to work with. 
# This pathname starts with the root directory, followed by all subdirectories up to the actual filename. 
# No matter what your current directory is, absolute filenames will always work. 
# An example of an absolute filename is /home/lisa/file1.
# relative paths
# A relative filename is relative to the current directory as shown with the pwd command. 
# It contains only the elements that are required to get from the current directory up to the item you need. 
# Suppose that your current directory is /home (as shown by the pwd command). 
# When you refer to the relative filename lisa/file1, you are referring to the absolute filename /home/lisa/file1.

# coppy files from one location to another
cp /etc/hosts /tmp

# move files from one location to another
mv myfile /tmp

# multiple commands on the same line
# create directory
mkdir somefiles; mv somefiles /tmp

# delete a file or folder
rm myfile
rm -r mydir

# exercises
# 1. Type pwd. You should be in the directory /home/$USER.
# 2. Type mkdir newfiles oldfiles
# Type ls
# You’ll see the two directories you have just created, as well as some other direc-
# tories that already existed in the user home directory.
# 3. Type touch newfiles/.hidden; touch newfiles/unhidden
# This creates two files in the directory newfiles.
# 4. Type cd oldfiles
# 5. Type ls -al
# This shows two items only: ., which refers to the current directory; and .., which
# refers to the item above this (the parent directory).
# 6. Type ls -al ../newfiles
# In this command, you are using a relative pathname to refer to the contents of
# the /home/$USER/newfiles directory.
# 7. Use the command cp -a ../newfiles/ . (notice the space between the / and the . at
# the end of the command).
# 8. Type ls -a
# You see that you have created the subdirectory newfiles into the directory oldfiles.
# 9. Make sure that you are still in /home/$USER/oldfiles, and type rm -rf newfiles
# 10. Now use the command cp -a ../newfiles/* . (notice the space between the *
# and .). Type ls -al to see what has been copied now. You’ll see that the hidden file
# has not been copied.
# 11. To make sure that you copy hidden files as well as regular files, use cp -a
# ../newfiles/. .
# 12. Verify the command worked this time, using ls -al
# You’ll notice that the hidden files as well as the regular files have been success-
# fully copied.
